            <p>Our website address is: http://polychord.io.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__header">What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Comments</h3>
            <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in
            the comments form, and also the visitor's IP address and browser user 
            agent string to help spam detection.</p>
            <p>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a 
            hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using 
            it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: 
            https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your 
            profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Media</h3>
            <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading 
            images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the 
            website can download and extract any location data from images on the 
            website.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Contact forms</h3>
            <p>We don't keep any of your contact information apart from the email 
            address you used to register with on this site's contact form.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Cookies</h3>
            <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your 
            name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your 
            convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when 
            you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
            <p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a 
            temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This 
            cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your 
            browser.</p>
            <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your 
            login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last 
            for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select 
            “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of 
            your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
            <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved
            in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply 
            indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1
            day.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Embedded content from other websites</h3>
            <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, 
            images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in
            the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed 
            additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that 
            embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded 
            content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. We 
            don't have control over that.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">Analytics</h3>

            <h2 class="privacy__header">Who we share your data with</h2>
            <p>Google Analytics</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__header">How long we retain your data</h2>
            <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained 
            indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up 
            comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
            <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the 
            personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can 
            see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
            cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and 
            edit that information.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__header">What rights you have over your data</h2>
            <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can 
            request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about 
            you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request 
            that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include
            any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security 
            purposes.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__header">Where we send your data</h2>
            <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>

            <h3 class="privacy__sub-header">How we protect your data</h3>
            <p>We protect your data by not keeping any of it. We don't keep any of 
            your contact information apart from the email address you used to 
            register with on this site. We run a secure server protected by SSL and 
            share no information with third parties unless obliged by law to so so.</p>
