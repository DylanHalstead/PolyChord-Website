                What is PolyChord?
            </h2>
            <p id="polychord-past__text">
                PolyChord Ltd is a spin-out from Cambridge University Astrophysics. Dr Will Handley originally designed the first PolyChord 
                algorithm along with Prof. Mike Hobson and Prof. Antony Lasenby to examine the 10-billion-year dataset collected by the 
                Planck satellite. Realising the underlying theory would have benefits across many different commercial sectors, they 
                sought to commercialise the tool under the direction of Mike Handley and formed PolyChord Ltd.

            After several stages of R&D with the initial algorithm, PolyChord Ltd is now a growing team of bright-minded scientists 
            creating exciting commercial software. Ranging from protein folding to predictive maintenance algorithms, PolyChord Ltd prides 
            itself in finding innovations in a multitude of fields. PolyChord Ltd has aspirations to build a bigger, stronger, 
            and more diverse team of data scientists to tackle more challenging projects, mainly focusing on predictive maintenance 
            technology and sensor-configuration optimisations.
